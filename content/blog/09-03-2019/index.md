Hello everyone,

Automation is truly the best productivity tool for developers and programmers alike. This allows us let our computers do the menial, mundane and repetitive tasks that we don't have time for. 

Alfred is a great automation software designed for specifically for Mac users. It gets you do things like set hotkeys for navigating web pages and Finder windows, manage system processes and automate shell scripts in the background.

Alfred also lets you import custom automation scripts, called workflows, posted by other Alfred users on the Web. This is the best feature Alfred has to offer because it makes integrating automation scripts trivial. I have found several workflows that I love to use and highly recommend for any developer/programmer in 2019. 

Here are the 5 best Alfred workflows that I use in 2019:
1. AlfredTweet
Use Twitter using your search bar! This workflow makes interacting with Twitter easy as pie. Some notable features include tweet, follow, unfollow, block, unblock, all using just the Alfred search bar. You can read more and download it <a href="http://www.packal.org/workflow/alfredtweet">here</a>.

2. Github workflow 
Ever wanted to access your Git repos more efficiently? Just use this workflow! It allows you to access specific Git repos by typing thier names into the Alfred search bar. You can read more and download it <a href="https://github.com/gharlan/alfred-github-workflow">here</a>.

3. Open in VSCode 
Using this workflow makes managing VSCode windows instantenous. Just navigate to the project Finder window and type ```code``` into the Alfred search bar and boom! You just opened your project in VSCode. You can learn more and download it <a href="https://vivaxyblog.github.io/2019/08/14/alfred-workflow-open-in-vscode.html">here</a>

4. Kill Process
Has an app ever crashed and left you to figure out how to close it? Not anymore! This workflow lets you terminate processes just by typing ```kill <nameOfProcess>``` which is ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ in my opinion. You can learn more and download it <a href="http://www.packal.org/workflow/kill-process">here</a>

5. Launch URL in 3 Browsers
Checking how your apps look and perform on three browsers has never been easier. This workflow lets you open a specified url in 3 browsers of your choice. You can learn more and download it <a href="http://www.packal.org/workflow/launch-url-3-browsers">here</a>
