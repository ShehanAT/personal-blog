I believe I am ready to make Web Development Â my profession.

So far I have made my own portfolio on my domain: https//shehan-tech.com. In my website the 'My Projects' page displays the numerous projects I have made. I have made 2 react and 5 node.js projects. Dylan Israel of Coding Tutorial 360 and Stephan Mayeux, two YouTube Coders, have been very valuable mentors to me in terms of building my projects. I uploaded my projects to Github check it out [HERE](https://github.com/ShehanAT).

i believe the biggest asset I can bring to a employer is my 2 years of hands on coding experience. During that time I have been following the FreeCodeCamp Front End Curiculum and obtained my FreeCodeCamp Front End Certificate this month.

I look forward to the job search and the my enterance to the world of professional web development
