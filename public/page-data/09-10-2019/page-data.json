It can be purchased for a small annual or lifetime subscription on their website <a href=\"https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/\">here</a>. </p>\n<h3>Highlighting features of Divi:</h3>\n<p>There are three things I like about Divi: it has lots of themes, it supports lots of third party plugins, and allows a high degree of customization.</p>\n<p>Firstly, Divi has over 140 unique layouts available at your disposal. This means they are most likely to contain layouts for specific niche websites you might be building. For example say you want to build a brand website for a cloud computing company. You could use the IT services layout and make small adjustments to transform it to your liking.</p>\n<p>Secondly, The number of third party supportive plugins for Divi is vast. For example say you want to insert a custom footer section to all the pages youâ€™ve built but donâ€™t want to do it manually. Well, you can use the Footer Plugin of Divi to automatically insert a custom footer section for all your pages. </p>\n<p>Lastly, the customization that Divi allows is massive. For example if you wanted to reuse certain sections you can save them to the Divi Library and reuse at will. Or if you want the header section to be one third of its current size you could set a fixed height for that specific header section. Maybe you want to insert a custom contact form instead of the one Divi provides. Well, you can insert a code section and type out a custom form using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Be warned though you will have to use inline css and javascript. </p>\n<h3>Some Wordpress Best Practices:</h3>\n<p>Now letâ€™s get into some Wordpress best practices: ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR WORK, avoid making global changes, and follow a process. </p>\n<p>The first point is the most important as consequences for not taking backups is earth-shattering. Trust me from personal experience that re-doing websites youâ€™ve lost to breaking changes youâ€™ve introduced through some weird plugin or theme is truly heart wrenching ðŸ’”. So take backups before activating plugins and/or themes!</p>\n<p>Avoid making global changes to a site as you never know the result of your actions. Remember that ambiguity breeds errors and unexpected behaviors. For example if youâ€™re using the Divi theme avoid extending specific module styles to the whole page. Rather, opt for extending for that specific row, column or, if youâ€™re really sure you know what youâ€™re doing, section.</p>\n<p>Finally learn to follow a process when doing manual work. What do I mean by this? If youâ€™ve making a section of site links for the footer, make sure that the process you use when setting links, styling and customizing modules is repeatable and predictive. For example if youâ€™ve adding customizations to modules and usually follow the sequence of change background â–¶ change font â–¶ change hover styles, follow that exact sequence for all the modules you edit. The reasoning behind this is that the human brain is very good at adopting patterns therefore sticking to sequential and repeatable patterns is paramount in order to avoid embarrassing mistakes and errors. </p>\n<p>Well thatâ€™s all for today, I hope you found this review helpful.
